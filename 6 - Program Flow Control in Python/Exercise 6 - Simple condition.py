# Coding Exercise 6 - Simple condition

# Write a small program that assigns the value 5 to one variable, called x, and the value 7 to another, called y.

# Your program should then use an if statement to compare the values, and print out "x is greater than y" if x is greater, 
# or "x is smaller than y" if y is greater.
# If x equals y, print out "x equals y".

x = int(5)
y = int(7)

if x !=y:
    if x > y:
        print("x is greater than y")
    if x < y:
        print("x is smaller than y")

else:
    print("x equals y")
